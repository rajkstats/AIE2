        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

The paper introduces QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while maintaining full 16-bit finetuning task performance. The paper presents innovations such as 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) data type, double quantization, and paged optimizers to save memory without compromising performance.\n",

Some of the key improvements of the LoRA system include:\\n\\n1. Long Range: LoRA technology enables communication over long distances, typically ranging from several kilometers to tens of kilometers in rural areas. This extended range makes it suitable for applications that require connectivity over large geographic areas.\\n\\n2. Low Power Consumption: LoRA devices are designed to operate on low power, allowing them to have long battery life. This makes LoRA ideal for applications that require devices to operate for extended periods without frequent battery replacements.\\n\\n3. Low Cost: LoRA technology is cost-effective compared to other wireless communication technologies, making it accessible for a wide range of applications. The low cost of LoRA devices and infrastructure makes it an attractive option for deploying large-scale IoT networks.\\n\\n4. Scalability: The LoRA system is highly scalable, allowing for the deployment of a large number of devices within a network. This scalability makes it suitable for IoT applications that require connectivity for a large number of devices spread across a wide area.\\n\\n5. Interference Immunity: LoRA uses spread spectrum modulation techniques to provide robust communication in the presence of interference and noise. This immunity to interference ensures reliable communication even in challenging environments.\\n\\n6. Flexibility: LoRA technology offers flexibility in terms of data rate, range, and coverage, allowing for customization based on the specific requirements of the application. This flexibility makes it versatile for a wide range of IoT use cases.\\n\\nOverall, the LoRA system's significant improvements in range, power consumption, cost, scalability, interference immunity, and flexibility make it a popular choice for IoT applications that require long-range, low-power communication.\",\n",

In the Bahdanau attention mechanism, the keys and values are the same vector.\\n But if we have thought for example the first row of the score matrix as:\\n[ word1/word1 word1/word2 word1/word3 word1/word4 ]\\nthen the elements of the attention vector (a row of the attention matrix) might be interpreted as somewhat a coded version of the row of the score matrix since in the product between two matrix we do rows*columns product.\\n In the latter case, if I get, for example, word 3, then the first element of the corresponding attention vector (row) is related to the first word, the second element to the second, and the third element to the fourth word ?.\\n Note\\xa0that Bahdanau et al.’s attention mechanism is divided into the step-by-step computations of the alignment scores, the weights, and the context vector:\\n$$e_{t,i} = a(\\\\mathbf{s}_{t-1}, \\\\mathbf{h}_i)$$\\n$$\\\\alpha_{t,i} = \\\\text{softmax}(e_{t,i})$$\\n$$\\\\mathbf{c}_t = \\\\sum_{i=1}^T \\\\alpha_{t,i} \\\\mathbf{h}_i$$\\nBahdanau et al. implemented an RNN for both the encoder and decoder.\\n The idea behind the attention mechanism was to permit the decoder to utilize the most relevant parts of the input sequence in a flexible manner, by a weighted combination of all the encoded input vectors, with the most relevant vectors being attributed the highest weights.\\n'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)', 'content': 'Note that the context vector for \"that\" does not rely on context vectors for the other words; therefore the context vectors of all words can be calculated using the whole matrix X, which includes all the word embeddings, instead of a single word\\'s embedding vector x in the formula above, thus parallelizing the calculations. More correctly, we should take the transpose of the context vector and use the column-wise softmax, resulting in the more correct form\\nThe query vector is compared (via dot product) with each word in the keys. The structure of the input data is captured in the Qw and Kw weights, and the Vw weights express that structure in terms of more meaningful features for the task being trained for.\\n On the first pass through the decoder, 94% of the attention weight is on the first English word \"I\", so the network offers the word \"je\".\\n Multiplying this against the value matrix effectively amplifies the signal for the most important words in the sentence and diminishes the signal for less important words.[9]\\n'}, {'url': 'https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-attention/', 'content': 'The human brain does so by relying on attention, such that it dynamically stores in memory the information that the human subject most pays attention to.\\nAttention in Machine Learning\\nImplementing the attention mechanism in artificial neural networks does not necessarily track the biological and psychological mechanisms of the human brain.

            "Agent Response: ### LoRA in Machine Learning:\n",
            "LoRA stands for \"Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models.\" It is an adaptation technique for large-scale pre-training in natural language processing. LoRA focuses on adapting specific subsets of pre-trained weights, such as q and v projections in a Transformer model. It aims to reduce the computational burden and enable faster adaptation of models. You can find more information about LoRA implementation in the [LoRA GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA).\n",

            "### Attention in Machine Learning:\n",
            "Attention in machine learning refers to a mechanism that dynamically highlights and uses the salient parts of information during model training. It allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, improving performance and alignment in tasks like translation and natural language processing. The attention mechanism involves components like queries, keys, and values to compute alignment scores and context vectors. You can learn more about the attention mechanism from resources like [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-attention/) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-attention-mechanism-8d044442a29).\n",
