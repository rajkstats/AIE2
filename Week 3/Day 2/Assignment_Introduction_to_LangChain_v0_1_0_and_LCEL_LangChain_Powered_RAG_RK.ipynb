The book mentions that if a non-hitchhiker (referred to as a \"strag\") sees a hitchhiker with a towel, they will automatically assume the hitchhiker also has other essential items like a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, and more. This perception of being well-prepared and resourceful by carrying a towel is a recurring theme throughout the story, highlighting the importance and value placed on this seemingly ordinary item.'"
